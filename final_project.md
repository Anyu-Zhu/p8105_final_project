## II. Project Title

**Where does money go?**

## III. Motivation

COVID-19 pandemic, which started in 2019, has been a great challenge for
global public health. Moreover, it has significantly impacted the
general society in many aspects, especially in global economics and
personal expenses. As data scientists, it is important to identify and
understand the trends, providing reference on personal spending for
individuals.

## IV. Intended Final Products

1.  Visualizations of changes in personal consumption expenditures from
    2019 to 2021.

2.  A model showing the relationship between personal consumption
    expenditures and the severity of the pandemic.

3.  A model predicting the future trend of personal consumption

## V. The anticipated data sources

-   Personal Consumption Expenditures by Major Type of Product and by
    Major Function:

<https://www.bea.gov/data/consumer-spending/main>

-   Personal Consumption Expenditures by Major Type of Product and by
    Major Function, by State:

## VI. The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

1.  Match the development of Covid 19 with the timeline from 2019 to
    2021 and analyze the correlation tendency of the personal
    consumption in different kinds of products and the development of
    Covid 19 in US.

2.  Analyze the relationship between kinds of personal expenses and the
    severity of COVID-19 (number of cases) via linear regression

3.  Analyze the relationship between kinds of personal expenses and the
    severity of COVID-19 (timeline) via time series

4.  Analyze how the trends of personal expenses vary by place/location
