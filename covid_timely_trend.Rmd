Import data
```{r}
covid_cum = read_csv("data/covid_cumulative_cases.csv", skip = 2) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

covid_day = read_csv("data/covid_daily_cases.csv", skip = 2) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

covid_daily = left_join(covid_day, covid_cum, by = "date") %>% 
  select(date, new_cases, total_cases) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month","day","year")) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb)) %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  arrange(year, month, day) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>% 
  arrange(date)
  
covid_monthly = covid_daily %>%

  group_by(year, quarter) %>% 
  summarize(quarterly = sum(monthly)) %>%

Plots
Daily
```{r}
daily_fig = plot_ly(covid_daily) 

daily_fig %>% 
  add_trace(x = ~date, y = ~new_cases, type = "bar", yaxis="y", name = "new") %>% 
  add_trace(x = ~date, y = ~total_cases, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", yaxis = "y2", name = "cumulative") %>% 
  layout(yaxis=list(title = "daily new cases", side="left"),
         yaxis2=list(title = "cumulative cases", side="right",overlaying="y"),
         showlegend=TRUE)
```


Quarterly (to correspond with the consumption data)
```{r}
covid_seasonal %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~quarterly, type = "bar") 
```
