## Data description
The `covid_cumulative_cases` data frame contains the cumulative amount of the covid cases in United State as time wents by. There are `r row_cum` days observed in total.
The `covid_day` data frame contains the amount of new covid cases in United State every day. There are `r row_daily` days observed in total.


## Data cleaning
We first used â€˜janitor::clean_names()â€™ to get a uniform naming scheme. From there, we combine the new case data frame and the cumulative case data frame together and seperate the time points into `month`, `day` and `year`. Then we created a new variable named `date` that rewrite the date into the form of `YYYY-MM-DD`.
In order to compare the covid case data and the comsumption data, we made a new data frame named `covid_seasonal` that reorder the covid case data by season (quarter 1 = January - March, quarter 2 = April - June, quarter 3 = July - September, quarter 4 = October - December). Then we write this data frame into a new .csv document.


Plots
Daily
```{r}
daily_fig = plot_ly(covid_daily) 

daily_fig %>% 
  add_trace(x = ~date, y = ~new_cases, type = "bar", yaxis="y", name = "new") %>% 
  add_trace(x = ~date, y = ~total_cases, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", yaxis = "y2", name = "cumulative") %>% 
  layout(yaxis=list(title = "daily new cases", side="left"),
         yaxis2=list(title = "cumulative cases", side="right",overlaying="y"),
         showlegend=TRUE)
```


Quarterly (to correspond with the consumption data)
```{r}
covid_seasonal %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~quarterly, type = "bar") 
```
